# concatglify
Takes all files in src, concatenates them into one file, uglifies that file, and outputs it into dist

## How to use
- Run npm install
- Insert all javascript files you want concatenated and uglified into src
- Navigate to the concatglify directory via command line
- Run the "gulp" command
- Your file will now be in dist under the name scripts.min.js, and you can see the file before uglification in dist/scripts.js
